=====================================================================

FIRST
@Talk to Rao about your idea.

Add the reward error option.
DO VIZ DOOM
REWARD-error and SPARSITY may work well ??

VIZDOOM is GREAT DEMO. Along with MNIST
MNIST is not ideal due to high feature overlap across all cases, and how some 8s are written like 1s.
Even in basic vizdoom, the distinction is a little more clear. i.e. gun far away from monster, or near monster.

COLORIZATION FOR READABILITY. HUMAN Interpretable.
Could use blue and red for colored reconstruction !! All low reward images go to blue. All high reward goes to RED


Stacked Autoencoder ? with CNN style.. Hmmm... write for later

EXPERIMENT
CAN you feed a partly recovered image repeatedly , and see if the number is recovered from it ??
EASIER experiment.  THIS IS KINDA EM. MAYBE makes sense wrt to preferences too.
Train on 4 and 7.
