@Talk to Rao about your idea.

?? can you quick test your idea using MNIST. all the data that is 9, make it all white.
Step 2: make a few numbers (that share features) noisy !! degree of noise ~ degree of reward
Step 3: When the reward is high, pay attention to the error. When the reward is low,
encode less (less adjustment!!).
IMPORTANT, YAS !! Step 4: What about encoding the negative or low reward to all zeros !! SO lower the reward
MORE random zeros. Increase the probability of flipping a pixel to zero. apply TO VIZDOOM
AT ZERO REWARD. 50% probability randomly.
@ google attention detection in visual data! and maybe add in RL keyword.

1) And your Reward driven AE, and expected result (in VIZDOOM basic, the reconstruction is better
when the monster and human are aligned !!)

2) in VIZDOOM basic, the reconstruction is better
when the monster and human are aligned !!)

4) Surveillance ( explicable exploration)  See your old hand notes. Say not really interested.
Will continue looking for a related angle.
