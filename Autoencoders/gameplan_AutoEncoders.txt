=====================================================================

@Talk to Rao about your idea.

YAS ! so the TARGET x, when changed allows the encoding to be a filter !!
NOW do a reward based noising. and see the effect.  0.5 I imagine is a threshold. TEST THIS !!
ALSO output the cross entropy of the decoded values.
HYPOTHESIS: Encoding 6, will help encode 8, even if the reward for 8 is low. (greater than 0.5)


?? DEPENDING ON THE loss, function may need to change the proportion of POSITIVE or NEGATIVE samples.

TRY PUSHING all the other numbers to pure black !! That will achieve the "opposite effect". Pushing things to the
background.

Tensorboard failed with your loss function. My guess is that it gives an array for the loss, as opposed to a single value !!
Try changing the loss function to an type that returns a single value !!



1) First have the reward be 1, and see that it works as normal. THEN change the reward
to 0.5, and see that it should still work, but like reducing the learning rate,
1.5) THEN use +1/0 reward, which should work like optimizing only a subset of pictures
1.7) Finally try +1/-1 reward which should be interesting.


?? can you quick test your idea using MNIST. all the data that is 9, make it all white.
Step 2: make a few numbers (that share features) noisy !! degree of noise ~ degree of reward
Step 3: When the reward is high, pay attention to the error. When the reward is low,
encode less (less adjustment!!).
IMPORTANT, YAS !! Step 4: What about encoding the negative or low reward to all zeros !! SO lower the reward
MORE random zeros. Increase the probability of flipping a pixel to zero. apply TO VIZDOOM
AT ZERO REWARD. 50% probability randomly.
@ google attention detection in visual data! and maybe add in RL keyword.

1) And your Reward driven AE, and expected result (in VIZDOOM basic, the reconstruction is better
when the monster and human are aligned !!)

2) in VIZDOOM basic, the reconstruction is better
when the monster and human are aligned !!)

4) Surveillance ( explicable exploration)  See your old hand notes. Say not really interested.
Will continue looking for a related angle.
