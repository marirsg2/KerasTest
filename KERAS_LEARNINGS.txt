When a layer is initialized with an input, the output is a TENSOR object THAT is ??
ALSO connected to layer !!! .
the input is also a TENSOR object. To manipulate these, need to use the backend
functions , such as when you want to calculate the mean and such.

1. You can write a function and have a "lambda" layer in keras

2. Check out the many loss functions, including cosine proximity, read carefully before use)

3. You can define your own loss function quite easily. See the "Variational_AE" script

4. See Variational_AE.py , in the fit function. Notice how the input is only one,
and there is no other output. The reason is that the input depends on the LOSS FUNCTION.
Here the loss function only needs "x" one input, and everything else is derived
from that. There is no other input needed. Aha !!
