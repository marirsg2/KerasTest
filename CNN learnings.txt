Pooling layers

QUESTION:
How is error propagated in max pooling vs average pooling

NOTES:
1) MAX vs AVG pooling: Max pooling is often used. Average pooling is sometimes used in very deep NN. Need more info.
2) PADDING: You can have padding in max pooling. Same meaning as in convolutions.
The same padding ADDS zeros so that there are no uncovered rows or columns.
Valid padding does not add zeros, and some rows and columns are dropped because the
convolution does not go over them due to size mismatch.
